# MA677 FinalProject - Empirical Bayeã€€

The Empirical Bayes Method represents a groundbreaking statistical approach pioneered in the 1950s by Robbins, Good and Toulmin, Stein, among others. Its significant breakthrough lies in its ability to estimate parameters solely based on observed data, without relying on assumed probability distributions or prior knowledge, which are key features of traditional Bayesian methods.

This repository provides an overview of the Empirical Bayes described in CASI-Chap 6 as a report with references to other literature.
In addition to the report, this repository also contains a Qmd file with sample code for estimating the number of insurance claims in R using Robin's formula.
